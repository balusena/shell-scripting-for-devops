## AWS Event Triggering
This project demonstrates how to set up an AWS Lambda function that is triggered by an S3 event when an object is uploaded
to a specific S3 bucket. The Lambda function sends a notification through Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) and can
also invoke another Lambda function. Hereâ€™s an explanation of each component in the project:

**s3-lamada-function:**
## 1. requirements.txt
- Contains the Python library dependencies for the Lambda function. In this case:
- boto3==1.17.95: This is the AWS SDK for Python, which allows you to interact with various AWS services (like S3, Lambda, SNS, etc.)
from within your Lambda function.
```
# requirements.txt

boto3==1.17.95
```

## 2. s3-lambda-function.py
- This is the Lambda function's main code file, written in Python.
- boto3 is imported to interact with AWS services programmatically.
- Lambda Handler (lambda_handler):
   - Extracts the bucket name and object key from the S3 event, which provides details about the file uploaded to the S3 bucket.
   - Prints the details about the uploaded file.
   - Publishes a message to the SNS topic informing that a file has been uploaded to the S3 bucket.
   - An optional block of code (commented out) to trigger another Lambda function based on the S3 event.
- SNS Client: Used to publish a notification to an SNS topic when an object is uploaded to S3.

```
# s3-lambda-function.py

import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract relevant information from the S3 event trigger
    bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    object_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

    # Perform desired operations with the uploaded file
    print(f"File '{object_key}' was uploaded to bucket '{bucket_name}'")

    # Example: Send a notification via SNS
    sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
    topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:<account-id>:s3-lambda-sns'
    sns_client.publish(
       TopicArn=topic_arn,
       Subject='S3 Object Created',
       Message=f"File '{object_key}' was uploaded to bucket '{bucket_name}'"
    )

    # Example: Trigger another Lambda function
    # lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
    # target_function_name = 'my-another-lambda-function'
    # lambda_client.invoke(
    #    FunctionName=target_function_name,
    #    InvocationType='Event',
    #    Payload=json.dumps({'bucket_name': bucket_name, 'object_key': object_key})
    # )

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Lambda function executed successfully')
    }
```

## 3. example-file.txt
- This is a sample file that will be uploaded to the S3 bucket as part of the demonstration.
- It contains simple text ("my name is bala senapathi"), but any file can be used here to trigger the Lambda function.

```
#example-file.txt

my name is bala senapathi
```

## 4.s3-notification-triggers.sh
- This is a shell script that automates the setup of the entire system. The script creates the necessary AWS resources 
and ties them together.
- Key steps in the script:
   - Get AWS Account ID: Uses AWS CLI to get the account ID of the user.
   - IAM Role Creation: Creates an IAM role for Lambda with permissions to be invoked by S3 and publish to SNS. The role
    is given permissions for full access to Lambda and SNS.
   - S3 Bucket Creation: Creates an S3 bucket where the file will be uploaded, triggering the Lambda function.
   - Upload File to S3: Uploads example-file.txt to the bucket to trigger the event.
   - Create Lambda Function:
      - Packages the Lambda function code (s3-lambda-function.py) into a ZIP file.
      - Creates the Lambda function with the necessary handler and role.
   - Add S3 Event Trigger: Configures S3 to trigger the Lambda function when an object is created.
   - Create SNS Topic: Creates an SNS topic that will be used to send email notifications about the S3 event.
   - Subscribe to SNS Topic: Subscribes an email address to the SNS topic to receive notifications.
   - Publish SNS Message: Publishes a message to the SNS topic to verify the setup.

## 5.AWS Services in Use:

### Amazon S3:
- Used to store the file (example-file.txt), which acts as the trigger for the Lambda function.
- S3 event notification triggers when a new object is created in the bucket, invoking the Lambda function.

### AWS Lambda:
- The Lambda function (s3-lambda-function) is triggered by the S3 event.
- Processes the event to extract file details and sends an SNS notification.

### Amazon SNS:
- SNS is used to send notifications to a specified email address when the Lambda function detects that a file was uploaded to S3.

### IAM (Identity and Access Management):
- IAM roles are created with specific policies allowing Lambda to interact with S3 and SNS.

## 6.Workflow:
- A file (e.g., example-file.txt) is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
- The S3 bucket event triggers the Lambda function.
- The Lambda function processes the event, extracts the details of the uploaded file, and sends a notification via SNS.
- The SNS notification is sent to the subscribed email address, informing the recipient that a file has been uploaded to S3.

## Conclusion
This setup demonstrates a common pattern in AWS for event-driven architecture, where different AWS services are interconnected
to respond to real-time events (like file uploads).
