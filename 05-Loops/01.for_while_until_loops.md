## Loops in Linux

## 1. For Loop
The `for` loop in Bash is used to iterate over a sequence of values. It has the following syntax:

```
for variable in sequence
do
    # Commands to be executed for each iteration
done
```
- **`variable`**: Represents the loop variable that takes each value in the specified sequence.
- **`sequence`**: Can be a range of numbers, a list of items, or the output of a command.

Example:

```
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

This will print:

```
Iteration 1
Iteration 2
Iteration 3
Iteration 4
Iteration 5
```

## 2. While Loop
The `while` loop in Bash continues to execute a block of commands as long as a specified condition is true. Here is the basic syntax:

```
while [ condition ]
do
    # Commands to be executed as long as the condition is true
done
```
- **`condition`**: Represents the test that determines whether the loop continues or terminates.

Example:

```
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Iteration $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```
This will print the same output as the previous `for` loop example.

## 3. Until Loop
The `until` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it continues to execute a block of commands as long as a specified 
condition is false. The syntax is as follows:

```
until [ condition ]
do
    # Commands to be executed as long as the condition is false
done
```

Example:

```
counter=1
until [ $counter -gt 5 ]
do
    echo "Iteration $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```
This will also produce the same output as the previous examples.

## Conclusion
Understanding the `for`, `while`, and `until` loops in Bash is crucial for efficient scripting in Linux. These constructs
provide flexibility in handling repetitive tasks and iterating over data, making them fundamental elements in shell scripting/Linux.
