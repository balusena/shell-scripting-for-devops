## Linux Functions Tutorial
In Linux, functions allow you to organize your code into reusable blocks, making your scripts more modular and easier to
maintain. This tutorial will guide you through defining and using functions in a Linux environment.

## Purpose of Functions in Linux Scripting
Functions in Linux scripting serve various purposes, making your code more efficient and maintainable. Here are some key 
reasons to use functions:

## 1. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
Functions promote the DRY principle by allowing you to write code once and use it many times. Instead of duplicating the
same code, encapsulate it within a function and call that function wherever needed.

## 2. Write Once, Use Many Times
Functions enable code reusability, meaning you can define a piece of logic once and call it multiple times from different
parts of your script. This not only reduces redundancy but also makes your script more modular.

## 3. Reduce Script Length
By using functions, you can break down your script into smaller, more manageable pieces. This not only improves code 
readability but also reduces the overall length of your script, making it more concise and focused.

## 4. A Single Place to Edit and Troubleshoot
Functions provide a centralized location for specific functionalities. If there's a need to edit or troubleshoot a particular
piece of code, you can do it in one place – within the function – rather than searching throughout the entire script.

## 5. Easier to Maintain
Functions contribute to better script maintenance. With a modular structure, you can easily locate, understand, and update
individual functions. This modular approach simplifies the process of maintaining and extending your script over time.

## 6. Reusable Code
Functions support the creation of reusable code. Parameters can be used to customize the behavior of a function, allowing
you to adapt it to different scenarios without duplicating the entire function.

## 7. Must Define Before Use
To use a function, it must be defined before its invocation. This ensures that the function is properly initialized and 
ready for use when called from other parts of the script.

## 8. Has Parameter Support
Functions can take parameters, allowing you to pass data and customize their behavior based on specific input. This 
parameterization enhances the flexibility and versatility of your functions.

## 9. Best Practice: Place Functions at the Top
A recommended best practice is to place all functions at the top of your script. This makes it easy for readers and 
collaborators to locate and understand the functions before delving into the main body of the script.

Utilizing functions in your Linux scripts brings numerous benefits, improving code organization, readability, and 
maintainability. Embrace this modular approach to enhance your scripting skills and create more efficient and scalable 
code.

## Defining Functions

### Syntax
A function in Bash follows the following syntax:

```
function_name() {
    # code to be executed
    # ...
}
```
Here, `function_name` is the name of your function. It should follow the same naming rules as variable names in Bash.

### Example
Let's define a simple function that prints a greeting:

```
greet() {
    echo "Hello, welcome to the Linux Functions World!"
}
```

## Using Functions

### Calling Functions
To call a function, simply use its name followed by parentheses:

```
greet
```
This will execute the code inside the `greet` function.

### Passing Parameters
Functions can accept parameters, allowing you to pass data to them. Parameters are accessed using `$1`, `$2`, etc., where
`$1` represents the first parameter, `$2` the second, and so on.

```
greet_with_name() {
    echo "Hello, $1! Welcome to the Linux Functions World!"
}

greet_with_name "Bala"
```
This will output: `Hello, Bala! Welcome to the Linux Functions World!`

### Returning Values
Functions can also return values using the `return` statement. The returned value can be captured using `$?`.

```
add_numbers() {
    local result=$(( $1 + $2 ))
    return $result
}

add_numbers 5 3
sum=$?
echo "The sum is: $sum"
```
This will output: `The sum is: 8`

## Scope
Variables declared within a function are local to that function by default. To make a variable global, use the `local` keyword:

```
global_var="I am global"

my_function() {
    local local_var="I am local"
    echo "Inside function: $local_var"
    echo "Inside function, accessing global variable: $global_var"
}

my_function

echo "Outside function, accessing global variable: $global_var"
```
This will output:
```
Inside function: I am local
Inside function, accessing global variable: I am global
Outside function, accessing global variable: I am global
```

Now you have a basic understanding of defining and using functions in Linux. Use this knowledge to write more organized 
and maintainable scripts. Happy coding!
