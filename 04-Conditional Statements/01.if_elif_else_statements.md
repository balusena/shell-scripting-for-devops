## `if-elif-else` Statements Linux:

## Conditional Statements in Linux Shell Scripting
In Linux shell scripting, `if-elif-else` statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. These statements
allow you to control the flow of your script based on whether a given condition is true or false.

### 1. Basic Syntax
The basic syntax of an `if-elif-else` statement in bash is as follows:

```
if [ condition ]; then
    # code to be executed if the condition is true
elif [ another_condition ]; then
    # code to be executed if the another_condition is true
else
    # code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
fi
```

### 2. Examples

#### 2.1. Simple Numeric Comparison
```
#!/bin/bash

number=5

if [ $number -eq 5 ]; then
    echo "The number is 5."
elif [ $number -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "The number is greater than 5."
else
    echo "The number is less than 5."
fi
```

#### 2.2. String Comparison
```
#!/bin/bash

word="Linux"

if [ "$word" == "Linux" ]; then
    echo "The word is Linux."
elif [ "$word" == "Unix" ]; then
    echo "The word is Unix."
else
    echo "The word is neither Linux nor Unix."
fi
```

#### 2.3. File Existence Check
```
#!/bin/bash

file_path="/path/to/somefile.txt"

if [ -e "$file_path" ]; then
    echo "The file exists."
else
    echo "The file does not exist."
fi
```

#### 2.4. Logical AND and OR
```
#!/bin/bash

age=25

if [ $age -ge 18 ] && [ $age -le 30 ]; then
    echo "You are between 18 and 30 years old."
elif [ $age -lt 18 ] || [ $age -gt 30 ]; then
    echo "You are either under 18 or over 30 years old."
else
    echo "Invalid age."
fi
```

### 3. Notes
- Ensure proper spacing and quoting in conditions to avoid syntax errors.
- Use appropriate comparison operators (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-gt`, `-ge`) for numeric comparisons.
- For string comparisons, use `==`.
- File-related conditions, such as `-e` for existence, can be useful in script logic.

These examples demonstrate the basic usage of `if-elif-else` statements in Linux shell scripting, along with numeric 
operations. You can modify and expand upon these templates based on your specific requirements.
