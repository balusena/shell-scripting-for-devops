## Pattern Matching and Text Processing with `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` in Linux
Pattern matching and text processing are common tasks in Linux scripting. Commands like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` are 
powerful tools for handling these tasks efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through the usage of these commands 
in a Linux environment.

## `grep` - Global Regular Expression Print

### Basic Usage
The `grep` command is widely used for searching patterns in files. The basic syntax is:

```
grep PATTERN FILE
```
For example, to search for the word "error" in a file:

```
grep "error" logfile.txt
```

### Options

- `-i`: Ignore case.
- `-r`: Recursively search subdirectories.
- `-n`: Show line numbers.
- `-v`: Invert match, i.e., show lines not matching the pattern.

```
grep -i -n "warning" -r /path/to/directory
```

## `sed` - Stream Editor

### Basic Usage
The `sed` command is a stream editor that can perform basic text transformations. The basic syntax is:

```
sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' filename.txt
```
For example, to replace "apple" with "orange" in a file:

```bash
sed 's/apple/orange/g' fruits.txt
```

### Options

- `-i`: Edit files in place.
- `-e`: Specify multiple commands.

```
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

## `awk` - Text Processing Tool

### Basic Usage
The `awk` command is a versatile tool for text processing. The basic syntax is:

```
awk 'PATTERN { COMMAND }' FILE
```
For example, to print the second and fourth columns of a file:

```
awk '{ print $2, $4 }' data.txt
```

### Options

- `-F`: Specify a field separator.

```
awk -F':' '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd
```

## Combining `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`

### Example Scenario
Let's say you have a log file and you want to find all lines containing the word "error," replace "error" with "warning,"
and then print the timestamp and error message.

```
grep "error" logfile.txt | sed 's/error/warning/g' | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5}'
```
In this example, `grep` filters lines with "error," `sed` replaces "error" with "warning," and `awk` extracts the timestamp
and error message columns.

### Practical Example - Extracting IP Addresses
Let's use `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` to extract IP addresses from a log file:

```
grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" access.log | sed 's/\./-/g' | awk '{print "IP Address: " $1}'
```
This example combines `grep` with a regular expression to find IP addresses, `sed` to replace dots with hyphens, and `awk`
to format the output.

## Conclusion
Mastering `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` is essential for effective pattern matching and text processing in Linux scripting. 
Whether you are searching for specific patterns, replacing text, or extracting information from files, these commands 
provide powerful solutions. Experiment with different options and combinations to tailor these tools to your specific 
scripting needs.
