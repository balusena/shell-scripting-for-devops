## Setting and Using Breakpoints in Linux Scripting
Debugging shell scripts involves adding points in your code where you can inspect the state of variables and the flow of
execution, commonly referred to as "breakpoints." While shell scripts don't have a built-in debugger like some programming
languages, you can employ various methods to achieve similar results.

## Using `set -x` for Tracing

The `set -x` option in a shell script enables debugging by printing each command and its arguments to the standard error
output (stderr) before executing them.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Enable debugging
set -x

# Your script commands
echo "Hello, World!"

# Disable debugging (optional)
set +x
```
This will print each line of the script to the terminal before executing it, allowing you to trace the script's flow.

## Printing Debug Messages
You can manually insert `echo` statements to print debug messages at specific points in your script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands
echo "Executing command 1..."

# Debug message
echo "Reached breakpoint 1."

# More script commands
echo "Executing command 2..."
```
By strategically placing `echo` statements, you can observe the script's progress and the values of variables.

## Pausing Execution
To simulate a breakpoint and pause the script's execution for manual inspection, you can use the `read` command:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands
echo "Executing command 1..."

# Simulate breakpoint
read -p "Press Enter to continue..."

# More script commands
echo "Executing command 2..."
```
This allows you to control the script's flow, providing an opportunity to examine variables or conditions interactively.

## Using Shellcheck and Linters
Utilize tools like ShellCheck and shell script linters to catch syntax errors, promote best practices, and enhance overall
script quality. While they don't set traditional breakpoints, they can help identify issues before runtime.

## Logging to a Debug File
Redirecting debug messages to a separate log file can be helpful for analyzing script behavior. You can selectively enable
or disable debug logging by setting a flag in your script.

```
#!/bin/bash

DEBUG=true

# Your script commands

if [ "$DEBUG" = true ]; then
    echo "Debug message 1..." >> debug.log
fi

# More script commands

if [ "$DEBUG" = true ]; then
    echo "Debug message 2..." >> debug.log
fi
```
This way, you can toggle debugging on or off by modifying the value of the `DEBUG` variable.

## Conclusion
While Linux shell scripts don't have a dedicated breakpoint mechanism, you can employ techniques like tracing, manual debug
messages, pausing execution, using linters, and logging to debug files. Choose the method that suits your debugging needs 
and allows you to effectively inspect the behavior of your scripts.
