## Writing Secure Scripts in Linux
When writing scripts for Linux, it's essential to prioritize security to protect both the script and the system it runs 
on. Below are key considerations for writing secure scripts.

### 1. **Input Validation:**
Always validate and sanitize input data to prevent vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.

```
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a filename: " filename

# Validate input
if [[ ! -e "$filename" ]]; then
    echo "File not found or invalid input."
    exit 1
fi

# Rest of the script
# ...
```

### 2. **Variable Sanitization:**
Avoid using user input directly as variable names or including it in commands without proper validation.

```
#!/bin/bash

user_input="user_supplied_input"

# Sanitize input before using it as a variable
sanitized_input=$(echo "$user_input" | sed 's/[^A-Za-z0-9._-]//g')

# Rest of the script using sanitized_input
# ...
```

### 3. **File Permissions:**
Set restrictive permissions for your script to prevent unauthorized access.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Restrict permissions
chmod 700 my_script.sh

# Rest of the script
# ...
```

### 4. **Use Absolute Paths:**
Always use absolute paths for commands and file references to avoid path manipulation attacks.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Use absolute paths
logfile="/var/log/my_script.log"

# Rest of the script
# ...
```

### 5. **Error Handling:**
Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle unexpected conditions and failures.

```
#!/bin/bash

if ! command; then
    echo "Error executing command."
    exit 1
fi

# Rest of the script
# ...
```

### 6. **Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Information:**
Avoid hardcoding sensitive information such as passwords or API keys directly into the script.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Use environment variables for sensitive information
password="$MY_SCRIPT_PASSWORD"

# Rest of the script
# ...
```

### 7. **Logging:**
Implement secure logging practices to record script activities and errors.

```
#!/bin/bash

logfile="/var/log/my_script.log"

# Log script activities
echo "$(date): Script executed successfully." >> "$logfile"

# Rest of the script
# ...
```

### 8. **Regularly Update and Patch:**
Keep your system and scripting tools up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

```
# Update system packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### 9. **Use Sudo Wisely:**
If your script requires elevated privileges, use `sudo` sparingly and only when necessary. Avoid running the entire script
as root.

### 10. **Testing:**
Thoroughly test your script in different environments and scenarios to identify and address potential security issues.

### Conclusion
By incorporating these practices into your scripting workflow, you can enhance the security of your Linux scripts and 
minimize potential vulnerabilities. Always stay informed about best practices and security updates to adapt your scripts
accordingly.
