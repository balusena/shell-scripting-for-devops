## File Manipulation Commands: `sed` and `awk` in Linux Scripting
File manipulation commands such as `sed` (stream editor) and `awk` (text processing tool) are powerful tools for performing
complex operations on text files. This tutorial will guide you through the usage of these commands in a Linux environment.

## `sed` - Stream Editor

### Basic Syntax
The basic syntax of the `sed` command is as follows:

```
sed OPTIONS 'COMMAND' FILE
```
Here, `OPTIONS` are various options you can pass to `sed`, `COMMAND` is the operation you want to perform, and `FILE` is
the input file.

### Examples

#### Substituting Text
To replace occurrences of a specific string in a file, use the `s` (substitute) command:

```
sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' input.txt > output.txt
```
This replaces all occurrences of `old_text` with `new_text` in `input.txt` and writes the result to `output.txt`.

#### Deleting Lines
To delete lines matching a specific pattern, use the `d` (delete) command:

```
sed '/pattern/d' input.txt > output.txt
```
This deletes all lines containing the specified `pattern` from `input.txt` and writes the result to `output.txt`.

#### Adding and Appending Text
To add or append text to specific lines, use the `a` (append) and `i` (insert) commands:

```
sed '/pattern/a\
    new_text' input.txt > output.txt
```

This appends `new_text` after lines containing `pattern`.

### `awk` - Text Processing Tool

### Basic Syntax
The basic syntax of the `awk` command is as follows:

```
awk 'PATTERN { COMMAND }' FILE
```
Here, `PATTERN` is a condition that triggers the command, `COMMAND` is the action to be performed, and `FILE` is the input file.

### Examples

#### Printing Specific Columns
To print specific columns from a file, use the `{ print }` statement:

```
awk '{ print $2, $4 }' input.txt
```
This prints the second and fourth columns of each line in `input.txt`.

#### Conditionally Printing Lines
To print lines based on a condition, use an `if` statement:

```
awk '{ if ($3 > 50) print $0 }' input.txt
```
This prints the entire line if the value in the third column is greater than 50.

#### Calculating Sum or Average
To calculate the sum or average of a column, use variables and update them for each line:

```
awk '{ sum += $2 } END { print "Sum:", sum, "Average:", sum/NR }' input.txt
```
This calculates the sum and average of the values in the second column and prints the result at the end.

## Conclusion
`sed` and `awk` are powerful tools for file manipulation in Linux scripting. Whether you need to perform text substitutions,
deletions, or complex text processing, these commands provide efficient solutions. Experiment with the examples provided 
to master the usage of `sed` and `awk` in your Linux scripts.
