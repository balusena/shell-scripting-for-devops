## Checking File Existence and Type in Linux Scripting
Checking whether a file exists and determining its type are common tasks in Linux scripting. This tutorial will guide you
through the process of checking file existence and type, providing various methods and techniques in a Linux environment.

## Checking File Existence

### Using Conditional Statements
You can use conditional statements in Bash to check if a file exists:

```
filename="example.txt"

if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
    echo "File exists: $filename"
else
    echo "File not found: $filename"
fi
```
Here, `-e` checks for the existence of the file.

### Using `test` Command
The `test` command can also be used for file existence checks:

```
filename="example.txt"

if test -e "$filename"; then
    echo "File exists: $filename"
else
    echo "File not found: $filename"
fi
```

### Using `[[` and `]]` Operators
The `[[` and `]]` operators provide extended conditional expressions:

```
filename="example.txt"

if [[ -e "$filename" ]]; then
    echo "File exists: $filename"
else
    echo "File not found: $filename"
fi
```

## Checking File Type

### Using `file` Command
The `file` command is a versatile tool for determining the type of a file:

```
filename="example.txt"
file_type=$(file -b "$filename")
echo "File type: $file_type"
```

### Using `stat` Command
The `stat` command provides detailed information about a file, including its type:

```
filename="example.txt"
file_type=$(stat -c %F "$filename")
echo "File type: $file_type"
```
Here, `%F` in the format string specifies the file type.

### Using File Extensions
Checking file extensions is a simple way to infer file types:

```
filename="example.txt"
extension="${filename##*.}"

case "$extension" in
    txt)
        echo "Text file: $filename"
        ;;
    jpg | jpeg | png)
        echo "Image file: $filename"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown file type: $filename"
        ;;
esac
```

## Conclusion
Checking file existence and determining file types are essential tasks in Linux scripting. Whether you need to handle 
different file scenarios or validate input, these techniques will help you build robust and versatile scripts. Experiment
with these methods to efficiently manage file-related operations in your Linux scripts.
