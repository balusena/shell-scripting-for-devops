## Reading from and Writing to Files in Linux Scripting
Working with files is a fundamental aspect of Linux scripting. This tutorial will guide you through the process of reading
from and writing to files, exploring various methods and techniques in a Linux environment.

## Reading from Files

### Reading Entire File Content
To read the entire content of a file, you can use commands like `cat` or `echo` along with command substitution:

```
file_content=$(cat filename.txt)
echo "$file_content"
```

### Reading Line by Line
To read a file line by line, you can use a `while` loop with the `read` command:

```
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "Line: $line"
done < filename.txt
```
Here, `IFS` is set to preserve leading and trailing whitespaces in each line.

### Using `awk` and `sed`
Commands like `awk` and `sed` provide powerful text-processing capabilities. For example, using `awk` to print specific columns:

```
awk '{print $2}' filename.txt
```

### Checking File Existence
Before reading from a file, it's advisable to check if the file exists:

```
filename="example.txt"

if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
    file_content=$(cat "$filename")
    echo "$file_content"
else
    echo "File not found: $filename"
fi
```

## Writing to Files

### Writing Entire Content
To write content to a file, you can use redirection (`>` or `>>`):

```
echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt  # Overwrites the file
echo "Appended Text" >> output.txt  # Appends to the file
```

### Writing with `printf`
The `printf` command provides more formatting options:

```
printf "Name: %s\nAge: %d\n" "Bala" 100 > profile.txt
```

### Appending Multiple Lines
To append multiple lines to a file, you can use a here document:

```
cat <<EOF >> output.txt
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
EOF
```

### Using `echo`
The `echo` command is suitable for simple text:

```
echo "New line" >> output.txt
```

## Conclusion
Reading from and writing to files is a crucial part of Linux scripting. Whether you need to process log files, configure
settings, or generate reports, mastering these file manipulation techniques will empower you to create versatile and efficient
scripts. Experiment with these methods to handle file operations effectively in your Linux scripts.
