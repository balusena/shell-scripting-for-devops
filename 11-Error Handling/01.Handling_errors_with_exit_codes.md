## Handling Errors with Exit Codes in Linux Scripting
Handling errors is a crucial aspect of writing robust and reliable Linux scripts. In Linux, commands return exit codes to
indicate the success or failure of their execution. This tutorial will guide you through the usage of exit codes for effective
error handling in Linux scripting.

## Introduction to Exit Codes
An exit code is a numerical value returned by a command or script to the shell. A value of `0` usually indicates success, 
while non-zero values typically represent various error conditions.

## Checking Exit Codes in Scripts

### Using `$?`
After a command is executed, you can access its exit code using the `$?` variable. For example:

```
ls /nonexistent-directory
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Directory not found."
fi
```
In this example, the script checks if the `ls` command failed to list the contents of a non-existent directory.

## Conditional Execution Based on Exit Codes

### Using `if` Statements
You can use `if` statements to conditionally execute code based on the exit code of a command. For example:

```
grep "pattern" file.txt
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Pattern found."
else
    echo "Pattern not found."
fi
```
Here, the script checks if the `grep` command successfully found the specified pattern in the file.

### Using Logical Operators
You can also use logical operators (`&&` and `||`) to execute commands conditionally:

```
command1 && echo "Command 1 succeeded" || echo "Command 1 failed"
```
In this example, the second command is executed only if the first one succeeds.

## Defining Custom Exit Codes

### Using `exit` Command
You can set custom exit codes using the `exit` command in your script:

```
if [ condition ]; then
    echo "Error: Something went wrong."
    exit 1
fi
```

Here, the script sets an exit code of `1` when a specific condition is met.

## Error Messages and Logging

### Displaying Error Messages
It's good practice to provide informative error messages along with exit codes:

```
command1 || { echo "Error: Command 1 failed."; exit 1; }
```
This ensures that users or other scripts can easily understand the cause of the failure.

### Logging Errors
Logging errors to a file or system log is also important for troubleshooting and monitoring:

```
command1 || { echo "Error: Command 1 failed." >> error.log; exit 1; }
```
This appends error messages to the `error.log` file.

## Conclusion
Handling errors with exit codes is an essential skill in Linux scripting. By checking exit codes and implementing conditional
logic, you can create scripts that gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide meaningful feedback to users. Incorporate
these techniques into your scripts to enhance their reliability and maintainability.
