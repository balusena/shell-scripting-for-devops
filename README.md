# Shell Scripting For DevOps

![Shell Scripting](https://github.com/balusena/shell-scripting-for-devops/blob/main/shell-scripting.png)

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to Shell Scripting for DevOps using Bash. It starts with an introduction
to Bash and its importance in automation. Key topics include basic commands, file permissions, and variable management. 
It covers control flow with conditional statements and loops, as well as defining and using functions and arrays. The 
guide delves into file handling with tools like sed and awk, input/output redirection, and regular expressions for text
processing. Advanced sections address process management, job scheduling with cron, and security best practices for writing
secure scripts. Additionally, it includes practical examples and real-world scripts for tasks such as log analysis, data
processing, and system monitoring. This repository provides a solid foundation for mastering shell scripting in a DevOps 
context, incorporating best practices and a Linux cheat sheet for efficient scripting and automation.
