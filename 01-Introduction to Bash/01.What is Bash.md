## What is Bash? ðŸ¤”
- A bash script is a file containing a sequence of commands that are executed by the bash program line by line. It allows
you to perform a series of actions, such as navigating to a specific directory, creating a folder, and launching a process
using the command line.
- By saving these commands in a script, you can repeat the same sequence of steps multiple times and execute them by running
the script.

## Advantages of Bash scripting ðŸ¤©
Bash scripting is a powerful and versatile tool for automating system administration tasks, managing system resources, and
performing other routine tasks in Unix/Linux systems. Some advantages of shell scripting are:

- Automation: Shell scripts allow you to automate repetitive tasks and processes, saving time and reducing the risk of errors
that can occur with manual execution.
- Portability: Shell scripts can be run on various platforms and operating systems, including Unix, Linux, macOS, and even 
Windows through the use of emulators or virtual machines.
- Flexibility: Shell scripts are highly customizable and can be easily modified to suit specific requirements. They can also
be combined with other programming languages or utilities to create more powerful scripts.
- Accessibility: Shell scripts are easy to write and don't require any special tools or software. They can be edited using 
any text editor, and most operating systems have a built-in shell interpreter.
- Integration: Shell scripts can be integrated with other tools and applications, such as databases, web servers, and cloud
services, allowing for more complex automation and system management tasks.
- Debugging: Shell scripts are easy to debug, and most shells have built-in debugging and error-reporting tools that can help
identify and fix issues quickly.

Certainly! Bash, short for "Bourne Again SHell," is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user 
types commands that cause actions. It is one of the most widely used Unix shells, serving as the default shell for many 
Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.

- BASH is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, a punning name, which is a tribute to Bourne Shell (i.e., invented by Steven Bourne).

- Bash is a shell program written by Brian Fox as an upgraded version of Bourne Shell program 'sh'. It is an open source GNU 
project. It was released in 1989 as one of the most popular shell distribution of GNU/Linux operating systems. It provides 
functional improvements over Bourne Shell for both programming and interactive uses. It includes command line editing, key 
bindings, command history with unlimited size, etc.  
- In basic terms, Bash is a command line interpreter that typically runs in a text window where user can interpret commands 
to carry out various actions. The combination of these commands as a series within a file is known as a Shell Script. Bash 
can read and execute the commands from a Shell Script.
- Bash is the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's mac OS. It is also accessible for Windows 10 with
a version and default user shell in Solaris 11.

Shell: A UNIX Shell is a program or a command line interpreter that interprets the user commands which are either entered by
the user directly or which can be read from a file (i.e., Shall Script), and then pass them to the operating system for 
processing. It is important to note that Shall scripts are interpreted and not compiled, as the computer system interprets 
them and there is not any need to compile Shell Scripts in order of execution.

### There are different types of shells available in Linux Operating Systems. Some of which are as follows:
1. Bourne Shell
2. C shell
3. Korn Shell
4. GNU Bourne Shell

To know, which shell types your operating system supports, type the command into the terminal as given below:

` cat /etc/shells  `  

And to know where bash is located in your OS, type the below command and you will get a specific location:

` which bash `   

## History of Bash ðŸ”„
- Previously, most of the software in the UNIX world was proprietary and closed source. UNIX system was also not open-sourced
for which, you had to use a shell. There was a shell existed at that time named by "Bourne Shell" under the /bin/sh command 
which was proprietary and closed source. Bourne named after its inventor- Steven Bourne.
- Richard Stallman at that time began GNU project with Free Software Foundation (FSF) to create a UNIX-compatible operating 
system aiming everything as open-source. There was a lack of progress in the revolution. He needed a free shell that could 
run existing shell scripts. It was imperative to a completely open-source system built as one of the few projects he funded 
with FSF. Then on January 110, 1988, - - 
- Brian Fox (FSF employee) began coding on Bash and released Bash as beta, version 0.99 on June 8, 1989.
Brian Fox remained in FSF as the primary Bash maintainer till 1993. Then he laid off from FSF, and Chet Ramey 
(earlier contributor in FSF) got his responsibility.
- Further, on December 23, 1996, Chet Ramey released another bash version 2.0 for the public with a range of new features
over the old bash version.
- And now Chet Ramey is known for the official bash maintainer, and he continues to make further enhancements in bash.

Bash is the standard shell included with Linux. It is the most popular shell known today of being open-source and also 
with various productive features we read in the further topic. It is available for Linux distributions, macOS, Solaris 11,
and Windows 10 too. It is offering the best experience for its users with a lot of improvements.
