## Custom Environment Variables in Linux Scripting
Custom environment variables in Linux scripting allow you to store and retrieve specific information that your scripts 
may need. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating, setting, and using custom environment variables
in a Linux environment.

## Setting Custom Environment Variables
To create a custom environment variable, you can use the `export` command in the terminal or within a script:

```
export MY_VARIABLE="Hello, World!"
```
Alternatively, you can set the variable directly within a script:

```
MY_VARIABLE="Hello, Bala Senapathi!"
```
Remember that variables set this way will only be available to the current shell session or the script in which they are
set. To make them persist across sessions, consider adding the export statement to your shell profile file 
(e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`).

## Accessing Custom Environment Variables
To access the value of a custom environment variable, use the `$` symbol followed by the variable name:

```
echo $MY_VARIABLE
```
This will print the value of `MY_VARIABLE`.

## Example Script
Let's create a simple script that uses a custom environment variable:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set a custom environment variable
export GREETING="Bala Senapathi"

# Access and use the variable
echo "$GREETING, $USER!"
```
This script sets a custom environment variable `GREETING` and uses it to greet the user.

## Unsetting Custom Environment Variables
You can unset a custom environment variable using the `unset` command:

```
unset MY_VARIABLE
```
This removes the variable from the environment.

## Checking if a Variable is Set
You can check if a variable is set using conditional statements:

```
if [ -z "$MY_VARIABLE" ]; then
    echo "MY_VARIABLE is not set."
else
    echo "MY_VARIABLE is set to: $MY_VARIABLE"
fi
```
This script checks if `MY_VARIABLE` is set and prints its value if it is.

## Conclusion
Custom environment variables in Linux scripting provide a way to store and retrieve information within scripts and across 
shell sessions. Whether you need to pass configuration settings, control script behavior, or store temporary data, custom
environment variables offer a flexible and powerful solution. Experiment with these variables to enhance the functionality
and adaptability of your Linux scripts.
