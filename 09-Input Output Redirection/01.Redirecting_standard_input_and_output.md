## Input/Output Redirection in Linux Scripting
Input/Output (I/O) redirection in Linux scripting allows you to control where data comes from and where it goes, enhancing
the flexibility of your scripts. This tutorial will guide you through the usage of input and output redirection in a Linux
environment.

## Output Redirection

### Redirecting Standard Output (`stdout`)
Standard Output is the default channel for a command's output. You can redirect it to a file using the `>` operator:

```
command > output.txt
```
This will overwrite the content of `output.txt` with the output of the `command`. To append the output to the file without
overwriting, use `>>`:

```
command >> output.txt
```

### Redirecting Standard Error (`stderr`)
Standard Error is the default channel for error messages. You can redirect it similarly to Standard Output:

```
command 2> error.log
```
This redirects error messages from `command` to `error.log`. To redirect both Standard Output and Standard Error to the 
same file, you can use:

```
command > output_and_error.log 2>&1
```

## Input Redirection

### Redirecting Standard Input (`stdin`)
Standard Input is the default channel for a command's input. You can redirect it from a file using the `<` operator:

```
command < input.txt
```
This will take the content of `input.txt` and use it as input for `command`.

### Using a Here Document
A Here Document allows you to provide input directly within the script:

```
command <<EOF
This is
a Here Document
EOF
```

## Combining Input and Output Redirection
You can combine input and output redirection in a single command. For example, to take input from `input.txt` and write 
both output and errors to `output.log`:

```
command < input.txt > output.log 2>&1
```

## Pipes
Pipes (`|`) enable you to send the output of one command as the input to another:

```
command1 | command2
```
This passes the output of `command1` as input to `command2`.

## Conclusion
Understanding input/output redirection is crucial for efficient Linux scripting. Whether you are managing files, handling
command output, or chaining commands together, the ability to control where data flows enhances the versatility of your 
scripts. Experiment with these redirection techniques to master their usage in your Linux scripts.
