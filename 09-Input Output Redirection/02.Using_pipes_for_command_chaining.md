## Using Pipes for Command Chaining in Linux Scripting
Pipes (`|`) in Linux scripting allow you to chain multiple commands together, creating powerful and efficient workflows.
This tutorial will guide you through the usage of pipes for command chaining in a Linux environment.

## Basics of Pipes
A pipe (`|`) is used to redirect the output of one command as the input to another command. This enables you to create 
sequences of commands that work together seamlessly.

### Example

```
command1 | command2
```
In this example, the output of `command1` becomes the input for `command2`.

## Command Chaining

### Chaining Multiple Commands
You can chain multiple commands together using pipes, creating a sequence of operations:

```
command1 | command2 | command3
```
Here, the output of `command1` is passed as input to `command2`, and the output of `command2` is passed as input to `command3`.

### Real-world Example
Let's say you want to list all the files in a directory, filter for those with a `.txt` extension, and then count the number
of lines. You can achieve this with command chaining:

```
ls | grep '.txt' | wc -l
```
Here, `ls` lists the files, `grep` filters for those with a `.txt` extension, and `wc -l` counts the number of lines.

## Using Pipes with Built-in Commands

### Using `sort` and `uniq`
You can use pipes to sort the output of a command and remove duplicates with `sort` and `uniq`:

```
command1 | sort | uniq
```
This is useful for analyzing logs or lists.

### Using `awk` for Text Processing
Pipes are frequently used with `awk` for text processing. For example, to extract specific columns from a command's output:

```
command1 | awk '{print $2, $4}'
```
This prints the second and fourth columns of each line in the output of `command1`.

## Combining Pipes and Redirection
You can combine pipes with input/output redirection for more complex operations:

```
command1 < input.txt | command2 > output.txt
```
This takes input from `input.txt`, passes it through `command1`, and then redirects the output to `output.txt` using `command2`.

## Conclusion
Using pipes for command chaining is a powerful feature in Linux scripting. Whether you are processing data, analyzing logs,
or performing complex text manipulations, understanding how to chain commands together efficiently is essential. Experiment
with these techniques to build streamlined and effective workflows in your Linux scripts.
