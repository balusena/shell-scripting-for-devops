## User Define Variables
- A variable is a character string to which we assign a value.
- A variable is nothing more than a pointer to the actual data. The shell enables you to create, assign, and delete variables.

## Rules:
- The name of a variable can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character ( _ ).
- Variable names cannot be reserved words
- Variable names cannot have whitespace in between
- The variable name cannot have special characters.
- The first character of the variable name cannot be a number.
- By convention, Unix shell variables will have their names in UPPERCASE.

### The following examples are valid variable names −
```
_VARIABLE_NAME
VARIABLE_NAME
VARIABLE_1_NAME
vARIABLE_2_NAME
```

### Following are the examples of invalid variable names −
```
2_VARNAME
-VARIABLENAME
VARIABLENAME-SOMENAME
SOMENAME_A!
```
- The reason you cannot use other characters such as !, *, or - is that these characters have a special meaning for the shell.

## Declaring and Using Variables in Linux
In Linux, you can declare variables without specifying their data types. Variables are case-sensitive, and conventionally,
they are written in uppercase.

```
# Declare a variable
MY_VARIABLE="Hello, Linux!"

# Declare a numeric variable
NUM_VAR=42
```
- Note that there must be no spaces around the "=" sign: VAR=value works; VAR = value doesn't work. In the first case, 
the shell sees the "=" symbol and treats the command as a variable assignment. In the second case, the shell assumes that
VAR must be the name of a command and tries to execute it.

## Variable Assignment
You can assign values to variables using the equal sign (`=`). No spaces are allowed around the equal sign.

```
# Assign a new value to an existing variable
MY_VARIABLE="New value"
```

## Variable Usage
To use the value stored in a variable, precede the variable name with a dollar sign (`$`).

```
# Use the value of a variable
echo $MY_VARIABLE
```

## Command Substitution
You can use command substitution to assign the output of a command to a variable.

```
# Command substitution
CURRENT_DATE=$(date)
echo "Today's date is: $CURRENT_DATE"
```

## Special Variables
Linux has some special variables that provide information about the environment.

```
# Special variables
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"
echo "All arguments: $@"
echo "Exit status of the last command: $?"
```

## Readonly Variables
You can make a variable read-only to prevent it from being changed later.

```
# Readonly variable
readonly READ_ONLY_VAR="This is a read-only variable"
```

## System Variable in Shell Script
System variables in a Linux bash shell are created and maintained by the shell itself. These variables, with the exception
of `auto_resume` and `histchars`, are defined in CAPITAL LETTERS. Configuration of the shell can be customized by modifying
system variables such as `PS1`, `PATH`, `LANG`, `HISTSIZE`, and `DISPLAY`, among others.

There are several commands available for listing and setting environment variables in Linux:

- `env`: Allows you to run another program in a custom environment without modifying the current one. When used without an
argument, it prints a list of the current environment variables.
- `printenv`: Prints all or the specified environment variables.
- `set`: Sets or unsets shell variables. When used without an argument, it prints a list of all variables, including environment
and shell variables, and shell functions.
- `unset`: Deletes shell and environment variables.
- `export`: Sets environment variables.

## Common Environment Variables
- `USER`: The current logged-in user.
- `HOME`: The home directory of the current user.
- `EDITOR`: The default file editor to be used. This is the editor that will be used when you type `edit` in your terminal.
- `SHELL`: The path of the current user’s shell, such as bash or zsh.
- `LOGNAME`: The name of the current user.
- `PATH`: A list of directories to be searched when executing commands. When you run a command, the system will search those directories in this order and use the first found executable.
- `LANG`: The current locales settings.
- `TERM`: The current terminal emulation.

## Conclusion
Variables are essential for storing and retrieving information in Linux scripts and commands. Understanding their declaration,
assignment, and usage is crucial for effective scripting and automation.
