## Using `trap` for Signal Handling in Linux Scripting
Signal handling is an essential aspect of Linux scripting, allowing scripts to respond to events such as interrupts or 
errors. The `trap` command is a powerful tool for managing signals and executing specific actions in response to them. 
This tutorial will guide you through the usage of `trap` for signal handling in a Linux environment.

## Introduction to Signals
In Linux, signals are software interrupts delivered to a process. They can be generated by the system or other processes
to notify a script of specific events or errors. Common signals include `SIGTERM` for termination and `SIGINT` for interrupt
(e.g., pressing Ctrl+C).

## Basic Syntax of `trap`
The basic syntax of the `trap` command is:

```
trap COMMAND SIGNALS
```
- `COMMAND`: The action to be performed when the specified signals are received.
- `SIGNALS`: The list of signals for which the command will be executed.

## Handling Interrupt Signals

### Example: Trapping `SIGINT`

```
#!/bin/bash

cleanup() {
    echo "Script interrupted. Cleaning up..."
    # Add cleanup commands here
    exit 1
}

trap cleanup SIGINT

# Rest of the script
echo "Running the script..."
```
In this example, when the script receives a `SIGINT` signal (e.g., Ctrl+C), it will execute the `cleanup` function before exiting.

## Handling Errors and Cleanup

### Example: Trapping `ERR` and `EXIT`

```
#!/bin/bash

handle_error() {
    echo "Error occurred. Exiting..."
    # Add error handling commands here
}

cleanup() {
    echo "Script completed. Cleaning up..."
    # Add cleanup commands here
}

trap handle_error ERR
trap cleanup EXIT

# Rest of the script
echo "Running the script..."
```
In this example, the `handle_error` function will be executed if any command in the script returns a non-zero exit status
(`ERR`). The `cleanup` function will be executed before the script exits (`EXIT`).

## Ignoring Signals

### Example: Ignoring `SIGTERM`

```
#!/bin/bash

trap '' SIGTERM

# Rest of the script
echo "Running the script..."
```
In this example, the script ignores the `SIGTERM` signal. You might use this approach if you want to prevent external 
termination of the script.

## Conclusion
Using `trap` for signal handling enhances the robustness of your Linux scripts by allowing them to respond to specific 
events or errors gracefully. Whether you need to clean up resources, handle interruptions, or ignore certain signals, 
`trap` provides a flexible mechanism for customizing the behavior of your scripts in different scenarios. Experiment 
with these techniques to create resilient scripts that can effectively manage signal events.
